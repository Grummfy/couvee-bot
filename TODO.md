# TODO

* complete todo tag in code ;)
* use a logger like [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston)
* add translation see idea in https://github.com/dirigeants/klasa/blob/master/src/languages/en-US.js or use https://www.npmjs.com/package/l10n or use https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18n
* create more coherent game and player class to avoid issue (like change of the mind, etc)
* see how to store data without having a hell of Promise
